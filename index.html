            <h3>Ashravan's Journey</h3>
            <pre>
                Ashravan had always been a being of shadows, lost in the echoes of his past. When Shai restored him, the world around him burst into vibrant colors, illuminating a path he had long forgotten. He felt the weight of his choices pressing upon him, the soft whispers of his former self urging him to embrace the light.

                Days turned into weeks as Ashravan navigated this new existence, his heart racing with the thrill of rediscovery. He encountered the remnants of his former life, people he had wronged, and moments that haunted him. But with each encounter, he chose to be better, to forge connections rather than sever them.

                Yet, a storm was brewing. Shadows from his past converged, threatening to engulf him once more. He faced a choiceâ€”succumb to the darkness or fight for his newfound light. The climax unfurled like a tempest, emotions clashing and destinies colliding. In a decisive moment, Ashravan stood at the crossroads, embodying the essence of redemption and the courage to choose love over fear.
